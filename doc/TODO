 * INCLUDE pseudo instruction
   label declarations with : are local  (nested hash-tables needed ?)

 * MACRO / ENDM pseudo instruction (macro extension)

 * STRING_LABELS for DEFM  (predefined  STRING_LABELS, &filename, &date, &time)

 * LABEL und STRING_LABEL definition as option for z80-asm like -D PORT12=0x1234

 * set the (unused) 3rd and 5th bit of the F-register correctly
 
 * in hardware: provide a realistic DMA access model

 * in hardware: implement  Z80-DMA, Z80-PIO, Z80-SIO

If you wanna do something of it (or something more) you're welcome.
