<h2><a name="intro">1. Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
This file describes essenial parts of the Z80 monitor/disassembler. Things in
this document not described can be found in sources or man pages.

<h2><a name="works">2. How it works</a></h2>

<p> Debugger controls 64KB of memory as the Z80 CPU. All registers are stored in
variables including <i>SP</i>, <i>PC</i> (program counter). There are special
"registers" like <i>IM</i> and <i>MEMP</i>. <i>IM</i> is
only for user's information. <i>MEMP</i> is starting address of memory dump.
Registers and flags are displayed on screen
together with the status of the <i>IFF1</i>-flipflop, the <i>CPU-halt pin</i>
and the clock counter <i>T</i>. An important thing is
disassembling.

<h2><a name="disasm">3. Disassembling</a></h2>

<p>In file <i>simul.c</i> machine code is interpreted. Sequentially bytes are
read from memory
(generally IO-address) and looked up into disassembling tables until the
entire instruction has been decoded.
Tables are in <i>decode-table.c</i> file, headers are in <i>decode-table.h</i> file. 

<p> First one or two bytes select disassembling table. There are several
tables, each for different prefix. For no prefix, for CB prefix, and ED prefix.
Instructions with FD prefix use <i>IY</i> register, instructions with DD prefix
use <i>IX</i> register modifying <i>HL</i>-access interpretation.

<p> When table is given, one byte is read for instruction body. This byte is
line in the table. Line contains pointer to disassembling function and four
arguments passed to this function. Arguments are type and value of first and
second instruction operand. Then appropriate number of bytes is read from
memory. Function and arguments are stored in <i>current_instr</i> structure,
which is of type <a href="#instruction_type"><i>instruction_type</i></a>.

<p> All this is done in the <a href="#decode"><i>decode</i></a> function.

<p> Disassembling functions are in <i>execute.c</i> file, headers are in
<i>execute.h</i> file. These functions names start with <i>f_</i> prefix. There
are several auxiliary functions as <a href="#set_flag"><i>set_flag</i></a>, 
<a href="#is_flag"><i>is_flag</i></a> or <a href="#reg_str"><i>reg_str</i></a> 
in the <i>z80-mon.c</i> file.

<p> Disassembling functions can be called in two modes: print and exec mode.  
Modes are switched with global variable <i>cpu_wait</i>. 

<p> In print mode disassembling functions return only the disassembled
instruction. Next decode() calls the
global function <a href="#print"><i>print</i></a>, which prints string to appropriate position on screen.
This position is stored in global variable <i>row</i>. 

<p> In exec mode instructions are interpreted. This means modifying registers
and memory. Block instructions as <i>djnz</i> or <i>ldir</i> are executed step
by step. In case of <i>djnz</i> register B is decreated and if B is non-zero PC
is changed according to djnz offset. <i>ldir</i> is similar, it decreases BC
and on non-zero it subtracts length of ldir instruction from PC.

<p> Disassembling is realized forward only because it's impossible to
disassemble code backward unambiguously. This is due to we don't know length of
disassembled instruction. So if you wanna list backward in code you must enter
exact value to <i>PC</i> register.

<h2><a name="compile">4. Compiling</a></h2>

<p> z80-mon enables putting instructions to memory. Instruction is read from
input to a text buffer. Then function <i>compile</i> from Z80 compiler library
is called. Output is written to memory. If an error occurs an error function 
<a href="#error"><i>error</i></a> is called . This function writes an error
message and waits for a key. 

<p>The same principle is used in executing
instructions. If you press the "x" key you're asked for an instruction.
Instruction is compiled by the <i>compile</i> function, output is written to
temporary memory <a href="#tmp_memory"><i>tmp_memory</i></a>. Then function
<a href="#decode"><i>decode</i></a> is called on compiled instruction.
Instruction is executed. Moreover <i>compile</i> needs at least the functions
<a href="#takeline"><i>take_line</i></a> for its input and <a href="#writeto"><i>write_to_memory</i></a> for its output.

<h2><a name="console">5. Console interface</a></h2>

<p> I will not describe which functions print what on the screen and how they
do it, I'll neither describe functions for user interface. I'll describe
low-level interface which maintains writing to console, moving cursor, setting
colors, cleaning screen, clearing block of screen, reading keys, etc. All these
functions start with <i>c_</i> prefix.

<p> Low level interface is in file <i>console.c</i>, headers are in
<i>console.h</i> file. The interface is the only operating system dependent
part. In DO$ functions from <i>conio.h</i> are simply called. Under UNIX
console is controlled with ANSI escape sequencies. 

<p> Console must be initialized before use and shut down after use. For this
purposes there are functions <i>c_init</i> and <i>c_shutdown</i>.

<p> Function <i>c_getkey</i> returns pressed key, if it's a special key as
ENTER, ESCAPE, BACKSPACE, etc. it returns value <i>K_ENTER</i>,
<i>K_ESCAPE</i>, ....  These values are declared in <i>console.h</i> file.

<h2><a name="functions">6. Functions</a></h2>

<p> Not all functions are mentioned here. Only the ones mentioned above or the
important ones. Other functions aren't worth mentioning. You can see them in
sources.
<p>
<ul>
<li><a name="error"><b>void error(int n,char *line,char* message)</b></a> -
prints error messsage to the bottom of the screen and waits for a key.
<li><a name="print"><b>void print(char *str)</b></a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="data">7. Data</a></h2>

<p>Here are important data structures and variables. Other can be found and
explained in sources.
<p>
<ul>
<li><a name="instruction_type"><b>struct instruction_type</b></a>
<ul>
<li><b>void (*func)(unsigned short a1,unsigned char t1,unsigned short a2,unsigned char</b>
- disassembling function for the instruction
<li><b>unsigned char arg1,type1,arg2,type2;</b> - value and type of instruction 
argument 1 and argument 2
</ul>
<li><a name="tmp_memory"><b>_uchar tmp_memory[64]</b></a> - temporary memory

</ul>
