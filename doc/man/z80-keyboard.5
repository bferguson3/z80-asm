.SH NAME 
description of keyboard mapping used by IN on port 0.

.SH DESCRIPTION

If there is no readable file
.I keyboard_map
then there is a one-to-one mapping of characters to key codes. The key code
.I 0
means no character input.

If there is a readable the file
.I keyboard_map
, it must contain a mapping of key codes to characters.
Each line of this file is either a comment line or a mapping line.
A line starting with two hexadecimal digits followed by a Space is a
mapping line else it is considered as a comment line and ignored.

The first two hexadecimal digits of a mapping line indicate the keycode.
This must be unique in the file. Next in column 5 follows a printable character (Ascii code > 32)
and a Space or in column 5 and 6 are two hexadecimal digits or columns 5 and
6 contain both a Space. The last case indicates that this key code is unused
by the keyboard. In the first two cases the character in column 5
respectively the character identified by the hexadecimal number in column 5 and
6 is mapped to the key code.
If colum 7 exists it must be a Space and further columns in the line are
ignored.

The first two mapping lines must describe unused key codes. The first key code
is used to denote the case no key was pressed on the key board and the second
mapping line denote the case an unknown character is to map to a key code.
