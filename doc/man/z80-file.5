.TH Z80-FILE 5 "18 Apr 2018" "Z80-ASM Version 2.4" "File format"

.SH NAME 
description of file format used by z80-asm

.SH DESCRIPTION
The recommended filename extension should be 
.I .z80
The file consists of header, address and data. 

.SH HEADER
Header is 8 bytes long. It contains string 
.B Z80ASM 
(6 bytes - without trailing zero)
followed by 
.B 0x1a
character and linefeed character (
.B 0x0a
). The 
.B 0x1a
character is to persuade DO$ viewers to stop viewing the file. 
The newline character terminates the header.

.SH ADDRESS
Address follows the header as 2 bytes. These are interpretated as a 16-bit
start address of the data(code) to load.
The less significant byte comes first, most significant byte follows.

.SH DATA
Data come after address. Data are raw compiled program. Length of data can be 
simply calculated to 'length of file - 10' bytes.
