Requirements:
-------------

All you need is not love but following:

  * DO$ or operating system UNIX
  * GCC compiler (under DO$ it's DJGPP)
  * GNU make
  
This program wasn't tested on other platforms/compilers. But it's possible it
will work.


Installation:
-------------
Installation is very simple:

  * edit Makefile and set your operating system
  * type 'make'
  * if you want to install the binaries and manuals next, type 'make install'
  * read the doc directory
  * enjoy the z80-asm or z80-mon program
  * if you need examples of assembler source, see the programs directory

If you wanna use this program under DO$ you may convert all sources including 
makefile to CR/LF end of line. If you don't know how, it's your problem. 
Don't use DO$!
